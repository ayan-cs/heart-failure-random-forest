# Prediction of Heart Failure using Random Forest
Using the [Heart Failure Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) from Kaggle, I have tried to build a basic classifier using Random Forest to determine whether a patient can die based on some clinical diagnosis (features). The efficiency of the classifier have been determined using ROC curve and AUC score. Furthermore, I have tried to show whether there is a direct correlation between Diabetes and Death due to Heart failure by determining the number of patients having Diabetes died due to Heart failure.

Code with detailed documentation is available on the Jupyter notebook. Please find that in code section.

### Results
**Training accuracy score : 1.0**

**Validation accuracy score : 0.867**

**AUC Score of Classifier : 0.914**
