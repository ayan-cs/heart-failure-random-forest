# heart-failure-random-forest
Using the Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle, I have tried to build a basic classifier using Random Forest to determine whether a patient can die based on some clinical diagnosis (features). Furthermore, I have tried to show whether there is a direct correlation between Diabetes and Death due to Heart failure by determining the number of patients having Diabetes died due to Heart failure. For more details, please go through the Readme file.
